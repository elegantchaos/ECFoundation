This framework contains various Elegant Chaos utility classes.

These classes were written for my own use, so they aren't necessarily brilliantly 
documented at the moment, nor can I guarantee that the interface to them will remain unchanged.

That said, I'm open sourcing them in case anyone finds them useful.

See the [ECFoundation web page](http://www.elegantchaos.com/libraries/ecfoundation) for more information.

The code is distributed under the terms of the Elegant Chaos [liberal license](http://www.elegantchaos.com/license/liberal).
